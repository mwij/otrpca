# Online Tensor Robust Principle Component Analysis

A bit like [this](https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis-TRPCA) but in python, works for tensors of any dimension and has an online algorithm. The online algorithm is similar to [this](http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2016-004.pdf), but this one works for tensors of any dimension.

Different but relevent to [this](http://tensorly.org/stable/development_guide/index.html)





make notebooks look nice

Final edit
	remove print('copmuting....')
	pep 8 check


make otrpca have option to reiterate
make otrpca have option to define starting value for A_0
check if frontal_faces is really needed
t_product twice as fast?
