# Online Tensor Robust Principle Component Analysis

This is what I produced as part of my undergraduate [thesis](https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/170630). The trpca algorithm is similar to [this](https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-Robust-Principal-Component-Analysis-TRPCA) but in python instead of matlab and works for tensors of any dimension. The otrpca algorithm is similar to [this](http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2016-004.pdf), but this one works for tensors of any dimension (so can be applied to colour images, instead of just black and white).
